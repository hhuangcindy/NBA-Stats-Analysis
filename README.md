## Project Name
NBA Stats Analysis
## Software Used
Python
## Summary
We will use NBA game data from the 2018-2019 season to investigate how size affects player performance in the NBA. We will examine how player height, weight, and position contributes to performance. 

The big question we want to answer is: How do various attributes affect player performance?  

Three specific questions: 

What is the optimal height/weight ratio (in terms of shooting percentage)? 

How does score vary among different positions? Look at both total points and percentage of throws made. 

Do players have a better shooting percentage in home games or away games? 
## Dataset Description
